# Installation
* Install [PHP](https://windows.php.net/download)
* Install [SSH Client](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases)

Don't forget to add them to **environment variable**! (click [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml) to see how).

# Usage
Run **IP-Logger.bat** by double-clicking *(make sure you have installed **PHP** and **SSH** client on your machine)*:

1. Specify alias for website *(abc -> abc.serveousercontent.com)*.
2. Specify URL for redirecting *(selecting **https://google.com** will move you to it after you open **abc.serveousercontent.com**)*.

# Notes
* It has anti-bot protection (won't dump the same IP addresses).
* It will save the output to **capture.txt**.
